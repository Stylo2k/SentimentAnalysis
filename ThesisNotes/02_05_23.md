Results:
- sentiment and reasoning does not really tell me whether what was changed was good or bad.
- SentiCR is a real pain in the ass. It was lastly updated 6 years ago and has not requirements file. I am still trying to deal with that
- Gpt is a bit un-predictable. Cleaning and standarizing the data took the longest
- changed the dataset to include also reason and sentiment

Questions:
- I noticed on gh only the main branch is taken to calculate the IaC artifacts, what about the other branches? (future work, branches is not an issue; main branch is the default)
- we can probably provide the changes from the commits to the model and so start predicting actual inline changes


Future:
- Issues, filter on keywords (title, body and comments)
