General updates:
- The sentiCR model did not get pickelized, so right now I am training it and will then save it.
- No answer yet from the author, the file is not to be found :(
- Once the sentiCR model is pickelized, I will add it to the pipeline and then get its output as well
- I am validating all the output produced by all the models

notes:
- validate the output of all models and manually label them
- Daniel will go over the labelling and check it
- GPT is used as a reason and sentiment model not as ground truth
- GPT is one agent, then validate the output of the other agents
- record the info where we have a disagreement with GPT ; a tag for the disagreement
  - do we resolve the disagreement ?
  - first we look at the random sample then resolve the disagreement
  - I have to give a dataset and then give it to them
- Daniel will get back after alexander
- meetings will be based on events I will lmk when done then
