# points

- sentiCR is now running after A LOT of fixes, tried using an older version of python but did not work out.
so just used the local version and fixed the errors.

- Have not heard yet from the author of the paper, so SentiSE is still not running.
so file is missing, will see if I can find it somewhere online, maybe they referenced it somewhere

- I am busy validating all the output from all the models 


# notes

clean the dataset and check it

# future work

- fetch the changes from the commit hashes and see what changed and plug that into the model
- also get the PR and MR from the issues and plug that into the model
