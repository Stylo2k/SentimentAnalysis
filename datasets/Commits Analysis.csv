This commit upgrades the `data-science-2` EC2 instance type from `p3.2xlarge` to `p3.8xlarge`.

This instance is being used to evaulate the implementation of a GraphSAGE algorithm which will be used to generate related links for content pages across GOV.UK. To perform this evaluation, it is necessary to run the algorithm against a set of sample data.

Currently on the `p3.2xlarge` instance, it takes approximately 20 minutes to evaluate one page of the sample data (one content item) using the algorithm. By switching the instance type to `p3.8xlarge`, we roughly estimate that this time can be brought down to 5 minutes per page of the sample data.

By speeding up the evaluation process, we will be able to determine the suitability of the algorithm for the purpose of generating related links and will then productionise the process to be able to evaluate ~200K content items for the actual A/B test.

In terms of cost (at the time of writing), the `p3.8xlarge` is priced at $12.24/hr; we anticipate that we will need up to 8 hours of compute time, which would result in a total cost of $97.92. In comparison, the `p3.2xlarge` currently costs $3.06/hr - this would result in the same total cost of $97.92 as we anticipate it would take up to four times as long to completely evaluate our sample data.","cost-saving-instance, cost-awareness-instance",Positive

This setting is the timeout which is used by PostgreSQL to detect
deadlocks when running queries. The documentation for this option is:

> This is the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait on a lock before

> is relatively expensive, so the server doesn't run it every time it waits

This change might be a more contentious, or less scientific.

The main motivation behind this is to increase the time before we get
logs about queries waiting for locks (see
5af25cdb8a99ae5873b21c823300cd3e5ead883f). By increasing this threshold
I'm hoping we'll avoid getting lots of noise in our logs about queries
which are only waiting for a second whereas we're more interested (at
the moment) in the queries which seem to be waiting for much longer.

After reading the documentation for `deadlock_timeout` I started to
think that the default of 1 second is perhaps quite small for the sorts
of query durations we often get (especially Email Alert API and
Publishing API). The documentation says this setting should exceed our
typical transaction time, and although I have no doubt that our average
transaction time is well below 1 second, we often have transactions
which can take a long time to run. Checking for deadlocks is relatively
expensive so increasing this setting will reduce the potentially wasted
time spent looking for deadlocks in our long running queries.

We experience deadlocks pretty infrequently (looking through our most
recent logs I couldn't find an example of one being found) so I don't
feel like there are any major downsides to increasing the timeout from 1
second to 2.5 seconds.",other-false_positive,

Context
Reduce latency of update visibility on CDN

Changes proposed in this pull request
The approach is similar to that taken for tracking API Keys:

Lamda@Edge parses Origin Request POSTs and writes metadata to CloudWatch Logs
A second Lambda consumes these logs and triggers a CloudFront Invalidation Request against a list of paths
Guidance to review
The Lambdas are deployed on *.test.openregister.org so you can test the flow by POSTing to load-rsf in this environment.
Note that a limitation of Origin Requests is that they have not been processed, so we trigger an invalidation request even if the POST is not accepted by ORJ. (This is a trade-off as intercepting at this point in the request-response cycle allows us to access the POST body which may be useful data for downstream consumers.

Paired with @user 

* add post logger WIP

* Log event and add test request for post logger lambda

* (WIP) add a lambda to listen for log events and clear the cache

* Wait for createInvalidation to complete before exiting lambda

The handler is an async function, so we can use `await` to
keep it going until the callbacks have completed.

Without this, the lambda was terminating without running the callbacks.

* add host to payload

* terraform lamdba@edge

* update error message

* comment out logging of full event

* add terraform for cache-invalidator lambda

* upgrade node version and assorted tweaks

* remove unused arguments

* simplify promise

* Add new cache behaviour for /load-rsf

The new cache behaviour uses the /load-rsf path pattern and
associates the new lambda@edge function for logging load-rsf
requests.

The default cache behaviour should stay the same - it will be called
if the additional cache behaviour isn't matched (i.e. all requests
except for /load-rsf).

* I renamed the VPC created in the VPC module (vpcs.tf) to be `module
""demo""` instead of `module ""vpc""`. My reasoning behind this is that
using a command like `terraform state list` only shows the module
resource name, so if this code was ever being used in multiple
enviornments, it would be difficult to tell them apart. Consider now
that a state list shows an identifying word (`demo`):

```
aws_instance.training-vault-01
module.demo.aws_eip.nat[0]
module.demo.aws_eip.nat[1]
module.demo.aws_nat_gateway.this[1]
```

* Move TFVARS file to environment-specific name. Again, to support the
multi-environment approach in the future, would rather call these on the
command-line with `-var-file=demo.tfvars` (or whatever environment
you're working in).

* A lot of this came from reading best practices listed here:

each log sink level that's possible for each destination (with
billing_account as an exception - more on that later). Each test fixture
functions independently and relies upon environment variables that are

tests are invoked based on make targets from `Makefile`, and there are
dedicated targets for testing from the CFT Docker container as well as
directly from your laptop/machine.

A test fixture called `computed_values` has also been provided to
specifically test issue #10 of the log-export module. This test spins up
a project on the fly and passes that computed project ID to the

- m5a.4xlarge	only costs 2x more,  for 16 vCPUs (AMD EPYC),	64 GiB
- That would allow ~3-4 pods per machine (let's consider 3)
- Max of 50 machines: that should increase containers cap. to 150

Bucket notifications are used to continue app flow after Athena Query
results arrive. The reason for designing the application like this is to
limit Lambda Function runtime. This is done by invoking each function asynchronously.

1. The user submits the google form.
2. The API Gateway receives the post and triggers the collection Lambda
Function.
3. The collection Lambda Function stores the post data and triggers the
setup_processing Lambda Function.
4. The setup_processing Lambda Function starts execution of an Athena Query.
5. The Athena Query results file creation invokes the processing Lambda Function (via bucket notification).
6. The processing Lambda Function starts execution of an Athena Query.
7. The Athena Query results file creation invokes the response Lambda Function (via bucket notification).
8. The response Lambda Function formats the data into an email, sends
it, and invokes the cleanup Lambda Function.
9. The cleanup Lambda Function runs to remove temp files.
10. The user receives the Shooting Insights email.

- Athena query completion times can vary greatly and bucket
notifications are used to trigger lambda functions that require the
query results
- New Lambda function setup_processing ensures that the Athena table is
created before any queries are run against it
- Add a processing s3 bucket
- Add a temp bucket
  - This bucket is used for sharing data between the lambda functions (primarilly the new event data
  and athena invocation IDs)
- Add bucket lifecycles to expire old data, incomplete uploads, and to
transition data to cheaper storage tiers
  - The intelligent archiving option is being used
  - It may be better to explicitly specify a storage type transition
  after x number of days instead of using intelligent archiving
- Bucket notifications
  1. Processing
    - Notification attached to processing s3 bucket
    - Invokes processing lambda
    - Awaits create table athena query completion
  2. Response

prevent the dev enviroment from creating a nat gateway for each AZ. If the
instance count is 3 in dev the single nat gateway will still be enabled. This

There is a bit of assumption baked into this module about the fact that
the site is accessible at a URL in the format of

option, we can tell Cloudfront that our site should also be accessible
via other domains, namely our preferred ""openoakland.org"".

The caveat here is that for the TLS certificate, Amazon makes us
validate all aliases. We can automatically validate the primary fqdn
since it's in Route53, but not any aliases. So, when running the

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.

DB Instances
The basic building block of Amazon RDS is the DB instance. A DB instance is an isolated database environment in the AWS Cloud. Your DB instance can contain multiple user-created databases. You can access your DB instance by using the same tools and applications that you use with a standalone database instance. You can create and modify a DB instance by using the AWS Command Line Interface, the Amazon RDS API, or the AWS Management Console.

Each DB instance runs a DB engine. Amazon RDS currently supports the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server DB engines. Each DB engine has its own supported features, and each version of a DB engine may include specific features. Additionally, each DB engine has a set of parameters in a DB parameter group that control the behavior of the databases that it manages.

The computation and memory capacity of a DB instance is determined by its DB instance class. You can select the DB instance that best meets your needs. If your needs change over time, you can change DB instances.

This commit:
- removes the use of preemptible instances
  - jobs that had to run for a very long time and have multiple steps
  being run across different workers would make the whole build fail
  when a single worker goes away, making our use of preemptible
  instances hard.
- removes the use of local ssds
  - given that a pod that uses a pv provisioned by a local provisioner
  can only get scheduled again against that particular node (and in our
  use case, we expect to have VMs coming and going), that makes it a
  no-no.
- creates a `generic` pool for non-worker workloads (like metrics, web
  ...). This way we can not rely on the default pool that gke
  automatically creates for us.

this commit changes our distribution of concourse workers in a way to
have more web nodes that are half the size (vertically) than before, as
we've never been really fully utilizing their resources anyway.

it moves us from having 2 worker node pools of vertically large
machines, to a single pool with more nodes that are half the size that
they previously were (16vcpu 32GBram 1TBdisk --> 8vcpu 16GBram
750GBdisk).

the reasoning for not performing a ""divide by 2"" on `disk` is that
that's a resource that's still very highly utilized mostly in terms of
IOPS, but eventually, in terms of space too.

to achieve that, the `cluster` terraform module was updated to use a map
of node pools (rather than a list) so that we can update the set of
pools without needing to manually perform terraform surgery.

this commit is intended to allow the [`prs` pipeline] to co-exist with
`nci` in the `hush-house` gke cluster.

it does so by:

- adding a node pool to the cluster (`ci-workers-pr`) whose size is the
  same as we had previously in our BOSH deployment
- adding a deployment (`ci-pr`) that puts workers in such node pool.

As such deployment is supposed to run untrusted workloads, we needed a
way of restricting the network access that this deployment could have in
order to avoid lateral movements in the internal net (in the case of our
BOSH environment, we had a totally different network - in k8s, we'd need
to be in a separate cluster if we wanted to go w/ the same approach of
different nets).

This led us to enabling the enforcement of network policies in the
cluster, and creating a policy for `ci-pr` that would target the pods
delpoyed by it, effectively blocking internal connectivity to anything
we didn't want (i.e., anything that's not ci's TSA).

ps.: these changes have already been applied.

We currently rely on Elastic Cloud to hold our snapshots for the catalogue API ES cluster.

In order to make working with Catalogue API ES data easy to do locally and to do outside of Elastic Cloud for reduced time and expense, it is useful and more arguably more reliable to hold these in an S3 bucket we have direct access to.

This will replicate any incoming data to S3 bucket into
a backup bucket with ""Glacier Deep Archive"" storage type [1].

This storage type costs $ 0.00099 / GB / month. It's dirt cheap
and it's made for cases where rare access is required, like
once or twice a year.

Only drawback of this storage type is the retriving time. It might
take up to 12 hours to retrive a file storage in Deep Archive mode.

Storing files in standard S3 storage already has a redundancy, so having
a backup is a fall back of a fall back if data ever gets lost at some

The bitnami library offers a ready-made http/https server, which saves
time during testing. On the previous ubuntu image, the path to have
https was unneccessarily bumpy:
- the inbound ssh needed to work
- the user needed ssh/putty locally
- apt update
- apt install ngnix
- for these commands, the outbound also always needed to work, yet
another difficulty.

All these steps are not needed with a ready-made image.

The bitnami image is free of cost as well.

* Use list variable to set source_ips for LB

Instead of hardcoding source_ip ranges into the to module, make use of
variable.

Create a new variable with name `allowed_ips` with the default set to
`[0.0.0.0/0]`.  This change allows the user to restrict access to
external load balancer from only from a small set of ip addresses.

* Background: A managed instance group of workers is used in backend
services for global load balancing (HTTP/HTTPS Ingress) and output
for custom global load balancing use cases
* Add worker instances to a target pool load balancing TCP/UDP
applications (NodePort or proxied). Output as `worker_target_pool`
* Health check for workers with a healthy Ingress controller. Forward
rules (regional) to target pools don't support different external and
internal ports so choosing nodes with Ingress allows proxying as a
workaround

This commit includes all changes needed to implement kitchen-terraform
tests for the log-exports module. Tests are structured exactly the same
as examples: folders for each of the destinations, and subfolders for
each log sink level that's possible for each destination (with
billing_account as an exception - more on that later). Each test fixture
functions independently and relies upon environment variables that are
set within `test/ci_integration.sh` (environment variables for the SA
key json, project ID, and the parent resource
project/folder/org/billing_account). Like all the other CFT modules,
tests are invoked based on make targets from `Makefile`, and there are
dedicated targets for testing from the CFT Docker container as well as
directly from your laptop/machine.

A test fixture called `computed_values` has also been provided to
specifically test issue #10 of the log-export module. This test spins up
a project on the fly and passes that computed project ID to the
log-export module to ensure that the module can handle computed values.

The existing behavior of tag_filter is preserved, but will be removed in a future release. Additionally, specifying allow_tagged is no longer necessary as specifying any tag filter will automatically activate deleting tagged images.

This change

- adds a new task definition for Verify Frontend used in t3.xlarge instance type so that it can use more CPU and memory units.
- adds a conditional statement to ensure that it uses number of EC2 efficiently. This change is required because t3.xlarge supports 4 network interfaces whereas t3.medium supports 3 network interfaces. There are four different containers (analytics, frontend, metadata and beat-exporter). Each container needs a network interface to work properly. So t3.xlarge can support 4 containers whereas t3.medium supports 3 containers. That's why we do not need to double the number of EC2 instances for t3.xlarge.
- adds a conditional statement to ensure that it uses correct task definition for verify fontend for instance type. If the instance type is t3.xlarge, verify frontend app and its ngnix will have more CPU and memory units. If it is not t3.xlarge, verify frontend and its nginx will remain unchanged.
- replaces the generic variable `instance_type` with specific variable `ingress_instance_type`. This change allows us to choose instance type for applications running in ingress cluster only in different environment.

Other applications (e.g. metadata, analytics and beat-exporter) will remain unchanged. This change is needed for reducing the frontend application's CPU usage.

Terraform v0.14 will introduce a dependency lock file named
`.terraform.lock.hcl`.
https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/terraform-0-14-the-dependency-lock-file/15696

The lock file is an implementation detail and it's hard to update it
with the tfupdate command. Because the hash value format seems to allow
future terraform versions to change the hash algorithm gradually. If
tfupdate updates the lock file, it will be difficult to support multiple
terraform versions without an unexpected the lock file drift.

Perhaps a recommended way is to use the terraform command to update the
lock file. However most CIs use linux and laptops may be mac or windows
and if you run terraform on multiple platforms, it requires to generate
hashed for all platforms to avoid a lock file drift. So I added an
example for it, but I found it's inefficient because it requires
duplicate downloads for providers on init. I tried to use a plugin cache
dir or a local filesystem mirror, but I couldn't figure out a way to
avoid duplicate downloads on init. If I use cache or mirror, it doesn't
record zip hashes, and it records them only when download providers from
origin. I think the easiest way to use Terraform v0.14 with tfupdate is

the idea of using GKE, having a node pool optimized for running the LH batch jobs, and
using kube Jobs to manage a bunch of LH runs in parallel seemed promising. the pool
could regularly sit at 0, then autoscale when the LH pods are scheduled, keeping the
cost low. but alas. the autoscaler is too slow for this to work the way i want.
testing with a job that manages 70 pods: the pods go PENDING, and the autoscaler
takes ~1m to add one node and have it become Ready; then another ~1m to add another; etc.

it took 5 minutes to run 70 pods this way, and i want to run ~5000, so this is a
show-stopper. something like https://github.com/atlassian/escalator seems
promising for this kind of rapid autoscaling of nodes for this kind of
bursty workload, but it only works on AWS.

* Adds an S3 bucket for Elastic Cloud snapshots

We currently rely on Elastic Cloud to hold our snapshots for the catalogue API ES cluster.

In order to make working with Catalogue API ES data easy to do locally and to do outside of Elastic Cloud for reduced time and expense, it is useful and more arguably more reliable to hold these in an S3 bucket we have direct access to.

To complete this change we will need to make some changes to the Elastic Cloud configuration.

Why would anyone want to create zero instances?

Suppose there are templates being re-used for multiple environments, and in
a development or test environment, multiple major application roles/functions
(let's call them ""foo"" and ""bar"") are handled by a single instance to save on
costs. In production, however, each major application role lives on its own
instance(s) for better resiliency.

Since Terraform doesn't support conditional invocation of modules,
specifying an `instance_count` of `0` for ""foo"" and ""bar"" in dev/test
and an `instance_count` of `1` for ""foobar"", while specifying an
`instance_count` of `1` for ""foo"" and ""bar"", respectively, and `0` for
""foobar"", would permit reuse across environments and avoid a lot of
copy-paste that may drift.

**Note:** The SSM document association portion was the only part of this
template that was currently producing errors, so it's the only one I
addressed. This will technically still create all of the other base
resources like roles, iam policies, etc. We can tie those to
`instance_count` as well, if desired.",cost-saving-instance,

* Change k8s_filter to true by default - This will result in cost savings for our customers since we don't currently use the GKE logs.  When k8s audit logging reaches GKE, we can re-evaluate the default setting.
* Change ubla to true by default - This will put our storage bucket in compliance with CIS Benchmark 5.2
* Remove the bucket logging configuration options - This check was removed from the CIS benchmarks in 1.1 since the preferred method is to use Cloud Audit Logging.  Our CIS 1.2 report reflects this change, and we should be removing the 1.0 reports from the system ""soon""",cost-saving-unknown,

`LAMBDA_DETACH_BUCKET_POLICY_ARN` environment variables.

**NOTE**: These lambda functions currently don't exist and I'll update the
terraform resources later to pass the actual ARNs. This shouldn't change
the logic.

**Limitations**

Surprising GitHub webhook membership events payload don't include the user
role for the team where is added. And also, no events are published when
a user's role changes.

This means we don't have a way to tell if a user is just a ""member"",
""maintainer"" or ""owner"" in a team or when its level changes.

For simplicity we'll add the read/write policy to the user.
When/if we'll have a UI to handle permissions we can add extra logic to
attach a readonly policy when more appropriare.

We currently have a single Prometheus instance per cluster, which
monitors cluster health, application health, and service health (ie
Istio). This Prometheus instance sends alerts to AlertManager and can
send metrics to an AWS Prometheus workspace for longer term metrics
storage and analysis. Prometheus Adapter talks to this instance for
pod autoscaling.

For a small cluster, this setup resulted in the following usage:

* 10% of one vCPU
* 600-700MiB RAM
* 50,000 metrics ingested per scrape

This results in heavy resource usage, expensive long-term storage, and
Prometheus instance that will require GiB of RAM at moderate scale.

In this change, the Prometheus instance is split into three:

* One instance to monitor cluster and pod health (kube-prometheus-stack)
* One instance to monitor Flightdeck and applications (flightdeck)
* One instance to collect aggregated metrics (federated)

The kube-prometheus-stack instance is used only for monitoring and
alerting about cluster and resource health.

The flightdeck instance is used for monitoring and alerting Flightdeck
and (optionally) applications, as well as pod autoscaling.

The federated instance scrapes aggregated metrics from other instances.
Metrics from this instance can be sent for long term storage.

For the same cluster, this setup requires the following usage:

* 5% of one vCPU, split up among three pods
* 600-700MiB RAM, split up among three pods
* 90 metrics ingested per scrape

This results in lower over all cluster resource usage, now distributed
to avoid a single point of failure and make it easier to distribute
loads as the cluster scales.

It sends vastly fewer metrics upstream for ingestion, resulting in lower
long-term storage costs.

It also provides a generic instance for federation, making it possible
to add other Prometheus instances which can then be aggregated and
ingested.",other-false_positive,

This patch adds an auto-healing policy to automatically re-create the
vault cluster instance if the vault server stops.  One of the nodes in
the instance group is active as per [Vault HA][ha].  The other nodes are
passive and forward requests to the active node.  Two different health
checks are used because passive nodes return non-200 status codes by
default.

In addition, this patch:

 * Update Vault to 1.6.0 by default
 * Update image to Debian 10 by default
 * Defaults to e2-standard-2 instance types, which are less expensive
   and more performant than n1-standard-1.
 * Improves startup (and auto-heal recovery) time by starting the vault
   service as quickly as possible in the startup-script.

It's a bit naïve - CloudWatch's EstimatedCharges metric just increases

the gradient, so we can see the rate we're spending at. But this
is good enough for now.

This also adds a security group which will be added to every

This security group will be useful since we expect to have
multiple services that we wish most/all apps in ECS to send
requests to (statsd, prometheus) so this should reduce the
number of groups/rules we need to create.

family called 'smokey' unlike other task definition
families such as 'frontend-bill' or 'publisher-ecs'.

As you can see, each pipeline will update the smoke
tests with variables such as GOVUK_APP_DOMAIN - a
workspace-aware domain such as bill.test. However,
since the family is not workspace-safe, the smoke
tests will simply run the tests for the workspace
that last update the smokey task definition.

smokey task family for each workspace.",other-addition-billing,

We can't share the Frontend memcache with the EC2 environments, because
Frontend uses it to cache rendered HTML which contains links to Rails

Also:

- Tweak the config for the shared Redis while we're there; it's very
  similar to the memcache one so let's make the two consistent.
- Remove the defaults for instance types and added those vars to the
  per-environment `.tfvars`, to make it less likely that we'll forget to
  set them appropriately when adding staging and prod.
- Hardcode the standard ports for Redis and memcached; we'd never want
  to run them on nonstandard ports so on balance it's cleaner to get rid
  of the module variable and save on interface clutter.
- Use a slightly smaller and cheaper instance type for Redis.
- Use provider default tags to simplify tagging the Redis cluster and

  can only get scheduled again against that particular node (and in our
  use case, we expect to have VMs coming and going), that makes it a
  no-no.
- creates a `generic` pool for non-worker workloads (like metrics, web

this commit changes our distribution of concourse workers in a way to
have more web nodes that are half the size (vertically) than before, as
we've never been really fully utilizing their resources anyway.

it moves us from having 2 worker node pools of vertically large
machines, to a single pool with more nodes that are half the size that
they previously were (16vcpu 32GBram 1TBdisk --> 8vcpu 16GBram
750GBdisk).

the reasoning for not performing a ""divide by 2"" on `disk` is that
that's a resource that's still very highly utilized mostly in terms of
IOPS, but eventually, in terms of space too.

to achieve that, the `cluster` terraform module was updated to use a map
of node pools (rather than a list) so that we can update the set of
pools without needing to manually perform terraform surgery.

this commit is intended to allow the [`prs` pipeline] to co-exist with
`nci` in the `hush-house` gke cluster.

it does so by:

- adding a node pool to the cluster (`ci-workers-pr`) whose size is the
  same as we had previously in our BOSH deployment
- adding a deployment (`ci-pr`) that puts workers in such node pool.

As such deployment is supposed to run untrusted workloads, we needed a
way of restricting the network access that this deployment could have in
order to avoid lateral movements in the internal net (in the case of our
BOSH environment, we had a totally different network - in k8s, we'd need
to be in a separate cluster if we wanted to go w/ the same approach of
different nets).

This led us to enabling the enforcement of network policies in the
cluster, and creating a policy for `ci-pr` that would target the pods
delpoyed by it, effectively blocking internal connectivity to anything
we didn't want (i.e., anything that's not ci's TSA).

ps.: these changes have already been applied.

These settings configure how much available disk Elasticsearch will
allow itself to use before taking preventative action such as:
- preventing new replica shards from loading on a given node
- making the cluster read only

For Elasticsearch clusters where there is data being written and index
sizes are constantly in flux, it makes sense to have high safety margins
of free disk space.

On the other hand, for clusters initialized from a snapshot that won't
ever change, it's most efficient to allow using all available disk
space.

These settings allow tuning the cluster to fit any usecase along that

This patch adds an auto-healing policy to automatically re-create the
vault cluster instance if the vault server stops.  One of the nodes in
the instance group is active as per [Vault HA][ha].  The other nodes are
passive and forward requests to the active node.  Two different health
checks are used because passive nodes return non-200 status codes by
default.

In addition, this patch:

 * Update Vault to 1.6.0 by default
 * Update image to Debian 10 by default
 * Defaults to e2-standard-2 instance types, which are less expensive
   and more performant than n1-standard-1.
 * Improves startup (and auto-heal recovery) time by starting the vault
   service as quickly as possible in the startup-script.

* + Added `role_arn` variable indicating a friendly name of existing IAM
  role that will be used for the Lambda function. If set, the module
  will not create any IAM entities and fully relies on caller to provide
  correct IAM role and its policies. Using the variable allows the
  module to leverage an existing IAM role - for example, when an account
  has centralized set of IAM entities, or when deploying same function
  across multiple AWS region to avoid the module attempting to create
  duplicate IAM entities.

* `modules/lambda`: Applied recommendations from code review
 - Renamed `role_name` varaible to `existing_role_arn` - it now accepts
   ARN of an existing IAM role. Sunsequently `aws_iam_role` datasource
   has been replaced with `aws_arn` one, which is more efficient
 - Removed unnecessary `null_resource`, native `depends_on` works fine
   for resources with `count=0`

* Apply suggestions from code review

The ecs module creates NAT gateways for the ECS hosts to use for
egressing out to the internet. However, NAT gateways are rediculously
expensive. The solution is to use NAT instances instead, which are EC2
instances configured to act as NAT boxes. Because they are just EC2
instances we can use spot pricing to massively reduce the cost.

To be resilient we need a NAT instance in each availability zone. To
ensure this is the case we need an ASG in each AZ which maintains
exactly one spot instance. We also create an ENI for each NAT instance,
which will persist as spot instances come and go and provide a static ID
which can be used in routing tables.","cost-awareness-networking-NAT, cost-saving-networking-NAT",
